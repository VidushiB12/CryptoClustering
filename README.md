# CryptoClustering

This challenge involves machine learning using unsupervised learning.
First, the data is scaled and transformed and then the KMeans is used to train and predict the model.
The inertia is also found and an elbow curve is plotted for k values ranging from 1 to 11.
The elbow curve, together with the scatter plot for the best k value is plotted.
k-value of 4 is the best for the data provided.

The same steps are followed using the principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA elbow curve shows the best-value for k is still 4.
A comparison can be seen between the two techniques. Dimensionality reduction can help us find the important variance but can also lead to tight clustering due to loss of distinguished features.
